          I'm a curious problem-solver who enjoys building things, learning new
          skills, and working with others to bring ideas to life. I'm passionate
          about technology, but equally about collaboration, creativity, and
          growth. Whether it's exploring how data can tell a story, developing
          projects that simplify everyday tasks, or leading a team toward a
          shared goal, I find energy in connecting with people and taking on
          challenges together. Outside of coding, I enjoy spending time with
          loved ones, traveling to new places, exercising, cooking, and taking the
          to learn new things.

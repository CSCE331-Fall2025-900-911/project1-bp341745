            I'm a Computer Science and Applied Mathematics student with a
            passion for solving problems and creating practical solutions
            through technology. What excites me most is the process of
            developing software that simplifies everyday tasks, designing
            data-driven applications that tell a story, or experimenting with
            new tools to expand my skills. I thrive in collaborative
            environments where creativity and teamwork drive results, and I
            enjoy bringing people together to turn ideas into reality. With a
            balance of technical expertise and a genuine enthusiasm for learning
            and growth, I aim to contribute to teams through fostering connection, innovation, and shared success.

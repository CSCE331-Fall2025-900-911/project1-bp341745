          I'm a curious problem-solver who enjoys building things, learning new
          skills, and working with others to bring ideas to life. I'm passionate
          about technology, but equally about collaboration, creativity, and
          growth. Whether it's exploring how data can tell a story, developing
          projects that simplify everyday tasks, or leading a team toward a
          shared goal, I find energy in connecting with people and taking on
          challenges together. Outside of coding, I enjoy spending time with
          loved ones, traveling, exercising, cooking, and even listening to
          music when I feel like it. These parts of my life keep me grounded and
          gives me fresh perspectives to bring back into my work.

      and am eager to learn from others.

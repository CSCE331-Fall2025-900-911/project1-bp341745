          <p class="paragraph-text">
            My name is Brandon Perez, and I am a student with a Computer Science
            and Applied Mathematics background with a deep interest in solving
            problems and creating meaningful solutions through technology. I am
            fascinated by the process of transforming complex ideas into
            practical systems, whether that means developing software that
            simplifies everyday tasks, designing data-driven applications, or
            experimenting with new tools to expand my skill set. What excites me
            most about technology is its potential to connect people, streamline
            processes, and inspire innovation.

          <p class="about-me-column-text">
            Collaboration is at the center of how I approach both learning and
            professional work. I thrive in environments where creativity and
            teamwork drive results, and I enjoy bringing people together to turn
            ideas into reality. My background in leadership has helped me
            understand the value of communication, accountability, understanding
            people at a deeper level, and fostering a team culture that empowers
            everyone to contribute. These qualities guide how I hope to make an
            impact.

          <p class="about-me-column-text">
            Beyond the classroom, I have explored these interests through
            hands-on projects. Most recently, I developed a point-of-sale system
            that integrates a recommendation feature and provides data reports
            on customer orders. This project challenged me to consider how
            businesses use technology to manage operations and how predictive
            insights can improve decision-making.

          <p class="about-me-column-text">
            Outside of coding, I am committed to maintaining balance and
            perspective. I enjoy traveling to new places, exercising, cooking,
            and spending quality time with loved ones. These experiences help me
            grow personally and often spark new ways of thinking that I carry
            into my professional work.

          Ultimately, I aim to bring together my technical skills, collaborative
          mindset, and passion for continuous learning to contribute to teams
          where connection, innovation, and impact are at the forefront.

          During my internship experiences, I've had the opportunity to apply my
          technical knowledge to real-world projects, gaining valuable skills in
          full-stack development, database management, and software engineering
          practices. I contributed to building and refining applications that
          emphasized both functionality and user experience, while collaborating
          with teams to ensure quality and scalability. These experiences not
          only strengthened my proficiency with technologies like React,
          Node.js, PostgreSQL, and C#, but also deepened my understanding of how
          to design secure, efficient, and user-friendly solutions. My
          internships have reinforced my passion for problem-solving and
          innovation, and they continue to inspire me to pursue growth in areas
          such as UI design, payment systems, cryptography, and AI/ML.

          In developing my point-of-sale system, I wanted to solve a common
          issue my local restaurant was facing: waiting until items were completely out of
          stock before placing new orders, which often caused delays and
          inefficiencies. I built inventory management into the system so
          low-stock items could be flagged in advance, helping staff stay
          proactive instead of reactive. To take it a step further, I added a
          data reporting page that tracks which items are ordered on specific
          days and uses those patterns to predict future demand. This way, the
          system not only manages daily operations but also supports smarter,
          data-driven decisions for ordering and planning.

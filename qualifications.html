          I have a strong technical foundation in software development, with
          hands-on experience in building full-stack applications using
          technologies such as React, Node.js/Express, and PostgreSQL. My
          projects have involved creating intuitive user interfaces with modern
          frontend frameworks, implementing secure backend systems with
          authentication and role management, and managing data flow across
          relational and NoSQL databases. I've also worked with deployment
          practices, RESTful APIs, and cloud-based tools that emphasize both
          functionality and user experience.

        <p class="paragraph-text">
          I'm particularly interested in full-stack development where I can
          bring together frontend design and backend logic into cohesive
          solutions. I enjoy UI design for its creative problem-solving aspect
          and the opportunity to craft seamless user experiences. Payment
          processing and cryptography spark my interest because they blend
          technical precision with real-world security needs especially in the future
          of enhanced AI and quantum computing. Additionally, I'm drawn to AI
          and machine learning, as they offer exciting possibilities to build
          intelligent systems that adapt and learn from data.

          Community service is a cornerstone of my values, grounded in the Aggie
          principle of selfless service. I seek opportunities to make a
          meaningful difference in the lives of others through projects that are
          both impactful and intentional. Service is not only a means of
          addressing the needs of the community but also a way of fostering
          relationships and strengthening bonds. Through these efforts, I strive
          to uphold the spirit of selfless service by creating lasting change
          and cultivating a community built on shared purpose.

          In the Texas A&M Corps of Cadets, Squadron 17 was founded in 1992 as a
          memorial outfit honoring the lives lost in the Challenger shuttle
          explosion. The mission of Squadron 17 is to develop leaders of
          character, devoted to serving Texas A&M, the US military and the
          professional community through impactful leadership. Every year
          Squadron 17 has the privilege of participating in the NASA Memorial
          Service for the crews of the Challenger, Columbia, and Apollo.

          <a href="https://candle.org/who-we-are">Candlelighters</a>, founded in
          1993, began as a parent-led support group for families of children
          with cancer at Texas Children's Cancer Center and MD Anderson Cancer
          Center. Their mission is to connect families through compassionate
          support, practical assistance, and opportunities to create meaningful
          memories beyond hospital walls. Serving as a counselor with
          Candlelighters was a deeply meaningful experience. Surrounded by
          families enduring the hardships of childhood cancer, I saw firsthand
          the strength and resilience they carried through such difficult times.
          I had the privilege of standing alongside these families, offering
          support and companionship. Whether through fun activities with the
          kids or simply being present, our role was impactful in bringing
          moments of joy and relief during an otherwise challenging journey. The
          children especially loved having us there, and it was an honor to
          contribute to a sense of comfort, community, and hope.

          Each semester, Squadron 17 dedicates time to serving the local
          community through hands-on projects that leave a lasting impact. One
          such project, shown on the left, took place at
          <a href="https://www.gracetyler.org/">Grace Community School</a>
          in Tyler, Texas. During this initiative, we worked together to build
          disc golf drive boxes, create an outdoor chapel, and construct benches
          to enhance the school's campus. Beyond the physical work, the project
          was an opportunity to engage with the community, foster meaningful
          relationships, and demonstrate the value of teamwork and service.

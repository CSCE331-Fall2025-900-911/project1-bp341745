          Community service is a cornerstone of my values, grounded in the Aggie
          principle of selfless service. I seek opportunities to make a
          meaningful difference in the lives of others through projects that are
          both impactful and intentional. Service is not only a means of
          addressing the needs of the community but also a way of fostering
          relationships and strengthening bonds. Through these efforts, I strive
          to uphold the spirit of selfless service by creating lasting change
          and cultivating a community built on shared purpose.

            In the Texas A&M Corps of Cadets, Squadron 17 was founded in 1992 as
            a memorial outfit honoring the lives lost in the Challenger shuttle
            explosion. The mission of Squadron 17 is to develop leaders of
            character, devoted to serving Texas A&M, the US military and the
            professional community through impactful leadership. Every year
            Squadron 17 has the privilege of participating in the NASA Memorial
            Service for the crews of the Challenger, Columbia, and Apollo.

            of children with cancer at Texas Children's Cancer Center and MD
            Anderson Cancer Center. Their mission is to connect families through
            compassionate support, practical assistance, and opportunities to
            create meaningful memories beyond hospital walls. Serving as a
            counselor with Candlelighters was a deeply meaningful experience.
            Surrounded by families enduring the hardships of childhood cancer, I
            saw firsthand the strength and resilience they carried through such
            difficult times. I had the privilege of standing alongside these
            families, offering support and companionship. Whether through fun
            activities with the kids or simply being present, our role was
            impactful in bringing moments of joy and relief during an otherwise
            challenging journey. The children especially loved having us there,
            and it was an honor to contribute to a sense of comfort, community,
            and hope.

            Each semester, Squadron 17 dedicates time to serving the local
            community through hands-on projects that leave a lasting impact. One
            such project, shown on the left, took place at
            <a href="https://www.gracetyler.org/" target="_blank"
              >Grace Community School</a
            >
            in Tyler, Texas. During this initiative, we worked together to build
            disc golf drive boxes, create an outdoor chapel, and construct
            benches to enhance the school's campus. Beyond the physical work,
            the project was an opportunity to engage with the community, foster
            meaningful relationships, and demonstrate the value of teamwork and
            service.

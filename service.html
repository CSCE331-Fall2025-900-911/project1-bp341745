          Community service matters deeply to me because it reflects the core
          value of selfless service that has been instilled in me as an Aggie. I
          believe in seeking opportunities to make others' lives easier through
          impactful and intentional projects that address real needs. For me,
          service is not only about giving back but also about building
          meaningful connections and fostering a stronger sense of community.
          Through these efforts, I strive to create lasting positive change
          while growing alongside the relationships formed through shared
          purpose.
